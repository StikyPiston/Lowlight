*Lowlight* is an **Obsidian** plugin that allows you to highlight text in different colours!

To get started, install the plugin, and ensure that it is enabled.

Then, select some text in a note, press `Ctrl + P`, and type `Lowlight`. Press enter on the command, and choose a colour!

As a side note, you can also customize the colours that you highlight with in the plugin settings.
